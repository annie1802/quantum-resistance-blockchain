## Prologue — The 9-minute attack

Picture a Bitcoin transaction in flight. The sender hits send. The ~10-minute average confirmation window starts ticking.

At minute 9, an attacker with a large enough quantum computer has derived the sender's private key from their public key — visible to anyone on-chain — and reroutes the funds to their own wallet. The original transaction dies in the mempool, unconfirmed. The sender believes they paid. The recipient is still waiting. The money evaporated in 9 minutes.

This is not science fiction. It is mathematics that has existed since 1994 (Shor's algorithm) and hardware whose rate of progress has accelerated sharply over the last 18 months:

- In **March 2026**, Google published that breaking Bitcoin's elliptic-curve cryptography requires **fewer than 500,000 physical qubits**, down from the 20 million the same company estimated in 2019.
- Days later, researchers at **Caltech** and the startup **Atomic** showed that, using laser-controlled atomic architecture, **10,000 qubits** might suffice.
- Today's commercial quantum computers **already have between 1,000 and 2,000 qubits**.
- In **April 2026**, independent researcher **Giancarlo Lelli** broke the first public ECC key (15 bits) using a commercially accessible quantum computer and won Project Eleven's **Q-Day Prize** (1 BTC).
- In **January 2026**, the investment bank **Jefferies** removed 10% of its Bitcoin allocation from its model portfolios, explicitly citing quantum risk.
- **Google** has moved its own internal post-quantum migration deadline up to **2029**, six years ahead of NIST's baseline (2035).
- **Vitalik Buterin** (Ethereum's founder): *"crypto has until 2028 to avoid the quantum collapse."*

Expert consensus has contracted brutally. Two years ago the conversation was about 2040. Today it is about **2028–2032**.

Meanwhile, today's encrypted data is already being harvested — communications, blockchain transactions, medical records, classified emails — to be decrypted once the hardware exists. The practice has a name: *Harvest Now, Decrypt Later*. Brassard, awarded the 2025 ACM A.M. Turing Award (announced March 2026) for inventing quantum cryptography forty years before the world needed it, puts it plainly: *"all of the internet from the past 40 years will become an open book, and there is nothing you can do to save the past."*

**QRB exists so that the future is not that open book.**

## Executive summary

QRB (Quantum-Resistance Blockchain) is a Layer 2 (L2) blockchain built on Ethereum, designed from the ground up to resist quantum-computer attacks along **two complementary dimensions**:

1. **Post-quantum authentication**: digital signatures are replaced with algorithms standardized by NIST in 2024 (ML-DSA / CRYSTALS-Dilithium, FN-DSA / FALCON, SLH-DSA / SPHINCS+). This neutralizes Shor's attack against elliptic-curve keys — the 9-minute attack described in the prologue. **Implemented and demonstrable in the Phase 0 prototype (May 2026).**

2. **Post-quantum confidentiality** (Phase 3+ vision): a native privacy layer combining *stealth addresses*, confidential transactions with lattice-based commitments, zero-knowledge (ZK) proofs built on **STARKs** (hash-based, natively post-quantum), and optional *view keys* for MiCA compliance. This neutralizes the retroactive-harvesting attack against transaction history — data published today stays confidential even if someone has a quantum computer tomorrow.

On top of those two cryptographic dimensions:

- **Full EVM compatibility** and Ethereum developer tooling (Solidity, Hardhat, Foundry, MetaMask with a PQ adapter): any Ethereum app migrates without rewriting.
- **Native Account Abstraction**: hides the complexity and size of post-quantum signatures from the end user. UX equivalent to a normal Ethereum wallet.
- **Optional integration with QKD networks** (Quantum Key Distribution) for institutional clients already operating on physical quantum infrastructure (a research line, Phase 3+ vision; not a Phase 0 or Phase 1 goal). It is an exploratory possibility, not an early-delivery commitment. QRB would be the first blockchain to combine both families of quantum cryptography, the mathematical one (PQ) and the physical one (QKD/BB84).
- **A responsible funding strategy**: non-dilutive public grants in Phase 1 (NLNet, Ethereum Foundation, Optimism), a seed round in Phase 2, and only then a token issuance registered under a MiCA whitepaper with legal counsel.

This document describes the problem, the technical solution, the economic model, governance, the roadmap and the project's risks. It is aimed at developers, cryptographers, grant reviewers and, at a later stage, institutional investors.

## 1. The problem

### 1.1 Two quantum threats, not one

All of the public-key cryptography that underpins today's digital economy rests on two mathematical assumptions: the hardness of **factoring large integers** (RSA) and the hardness of the **elliptic-curve discrete logarithm** (ECDSA, EdDSA, Schnorr). In 1994, Peter Shor proved that a large enough quantum computer can solve both problems in polynomial time. This is not conjecture: it is proven mathematics.

From that single algorithm, **two distinct classes of threat** follow, which QRB neutralizes separately:

| Threat | What it breaks | Concrete example |
|---------|-----------|------------------|
| **A — Impersonation** (Shor on signatures) | The attacker derives the sender's private key and signs transactions in their name | The 9-minute attack on Bitcoin. Draining wallets with an exposed public key |
| **B — Retroactive harvesting** (Shor on channel encryption + decryption of stored data) | The attacker decrypts content captured years earlier | *Harvest now, decrypt later*. Retrospective reading of the chain's entire history |

Today's post-quantum industry fundamentally covers **Threat A** (resistant signatures). QRB positions itself as the first blockchain to cover **A and B** simultaneously. Section 7.5 details layer B.

### 1.2 The timeline has contracted

| Year | Estimated **logical / error-corrected** qubits to break ECDSA-256 | Source |
|-----|---------------------------------------------|--------|
| 2012 | ~1 billion (physical) | Academic estimates |
| 2019 | ~20 million (physical) | Google Research |
| May 2025 | ~1 million (physical) | Google Research (revised) |
| March 2026 | **< 500,000** (physical) | Google Quantum AI |
| March 2026 | **~10,000** (logical, atomic architecture) | Caltech + Atomic |

> **Methodological caveat — do not confuse physical qubits with logical ones.** The figures in the table are mostly *error-corrected logical qubits* (or physical-qubit estimates under specific architectures). A fault-tolerant logical qubit today requires **on the order of hundreds to thousands of physical qubits** for its error correction. By contrast, today's commercial computers (IBM, Google, Quantinuum, IonQ) have **1,000–2,000 noisy *physical* qubits**, without the error correction needed to run Shor's algorithm at this scale. So the real gap between what exists today and what is needed is **far larger** than a raw comparison of the numbers suggests, and the cost of breaking larger keys does not scale linearly.

The trend in the estimates, however, is unambiguously downward: several orders of magnitude of reduction in estimated resources over a decade. **The exact arrival date of a cryptographically relevant quantum computer (CRQC) is genuinely uncertain**; what is not uncertain is the direction, nor the fact that cryptographic infrastructure takes years to migrate. That asymmetry — slow migration versus a growing threat — is what justifies acting now.

Timelines published by serious actors:

- **Google**: internal migration completed by **2029**.
- **NIST**: transition standard set for 2035, but outpaced by industry timelines.
- **CNSA 2.0 (NSA, USA)**: classified systems fully migrated before 2035.
- **ANSSI (France), BSI (Germany)**: PQ cryptography mandatory for critical systems before 2030.
- **NIS2 (EU, in force since October 2024)**: quantum resistance as an enforceable duty-of-care criterion.
- **MiCA (EU, in force since December 2024)**: regulates crypto-asset issuers, opening the expectation of PQ requirements for tokens in critical infrastructure.

### 1.3 Harvest now, decrypt later: the heist that has already begun

Blockchain transactions are **public and permanent**. An ECDSA signature issued today will remain available for retrospective attack once a cryptographically relevant quantum computer (CRQC) exists. Addresses that have already spent have their public key exposed on-chain forever.

- In Bitcoin, **approximately 6.9 million BTC** (≈ a third of the total supply) sit in addresses with an exposed public key, including the estimated one million belonging to Satoshi Nakamoto himself.
- In Ethereum, the situation is similar for any account that has sent at least one transaction.
- The **encrypted communications** of 99% of internet traffic (TLS over elliptic curves) are being actively stored by state actors with long-term intelligence incentives.

The temporal asymmetry is what makes this attack devastating: the attacker does not need quantum capability **today**, they only need to **store**. Decryption can happen once the technology matures, against data that is 5, 10 or 20 years old.

### 1.4 Migrating existing L1s in time is mathematically improbable

A recent technical analysis of Bitcoin estimates that a full migration of the network's state to post-quantum addresses requires **a minimum of 76 days of continuous on-chain activity**, assuming unanimous community consensus from day one. Bitcoin's history shows that such consensus is never reached in less than 1–3 years. Ethereum has a more agile governance process but is equally slow. Solana, BNB Chain, Avalanche and the like have published no operational migration plan.

By contrast, **a PQ-native chain from day one has nothing to migrate**: it is born in the correct state. That is the structural window in which QRB exists.

## 2. State of the art

### 2.1 Extended comparison

| Project | PQ signatures | PQ privacy | EVM | AA | QKD-ready | Main limitation |
|----------|:---------:|:-------------:|:---:|:--:|:---------:|----------------------|
| Bitcoin / Ethereum L1 | ❌ | ❌ | partial / ✅ | ❌ / partial | ❌ | Migration politically blocked (76+ days, no consensus) |
| QRL / Zond | ✅ (XMSS → Dilithium) | ❌ | partial | ❌ | ❌ | Poor UX, minimal ecosystem |
| Quranium | ✅ (Dilithium) | ❌ | partial | ❌ | ❌ | Very small community and dev traction |
| Cellframe | ✅ (CRYSTALS, NTRU) | partial | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | Complex architecture, hard to fork |
| Naoris Protocol | ✅ (hybrid) | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | More a security mesh than a general blockchain |
| Aleo | ❌ (SNARK) | ✅ (not PQ) | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | Privacy not quantum-resistant |
| Aztec | ❌ (SNARK) | ✅ (not PQ) | partial | ✅ | ❌ | Privacy not quantum-resistant |
| Monero | ❌ | ✅ (not PQ) | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | Privacy not quantum-resistant, no smart contracts |
| **QRB (proposed)** | **✅ ML-DSA-65** | **✅ STARKs + lattice** | **✅** | **✅** | **✅** | Young project (Phase 0) |

No project on the market combines all five columns. QRB positions itself in that gap.

### 2.2 Why L2 and not L1?

A dedicated L1 forces you to solve the **validator-incentive problem**: convincing node operators to commit hardware and capital, which requires significant inflationary issuance of a native token and community bootstrapping. For a project that does not start from a €20–50M fund, this is prohibitive and historically leads to insecure networks for the first 1–3 years.

An L2 on Ethereum, by contrast:
- **Inherits the security** of Ethereum's settlement layer.
- **Inherits the liquidity** via established bridges.
- **Reduces the initial cost** by a factor of 10× relative to an L1.
- **Lets the team focus on what is differential** (PQ cryptography, privacy and UX) instead of spending resources reinventing consensus.

---

## 3. Technical solution — PQ authentication layer

### 3.1 Cryptographic stack

QRB adopts the NIST post-quantum standards as its authentication base:

- **Primary digital signatures**: ML-DSA (FIPS 204, CRYSTALS-Dilithium), specifically **ML-DSA-65** as the default. Equivalent to 192 bits of classical security. Signature ~3,309 bytes; public key ~1,952 bytes.
- **Opt-in alternative signatures**: FN-DSA (FALCON, FIPS 206) for cases that require compact signatures (~700 bytes); SLH-DSA (SPHINCS+, FIPS 205) for maximally conservative hash-based scenarios.
- **Key exchange**: ML-KEM (FIPS 203, CRYSTALS-Kyber), specifically ML-KEM-768, for encrypted node-to-node communication.
- **Hashing**: Keccak-256 (EVM compatibility) and SHA3-512 as a precompile for applications with an explicit post-quantum margin against Grover.

### 3.2 Hybrid signatures during the transition

During mainnet's first 24 months, QRB will offer an optional **hybrid signature** mode: each transaction can be signed simultaneously with ECDSA-secp256k1 and with ML-DSA. The transaction is only considered valid if **both** signatures are. This mechanism enables progressive migration without an abrupt cutover.

### 3.3 PQ Account Abstraction

PQ signatures are ~50× larger than ECDSA. To prevent this from degrading the user experience, QRB implements **native Account Abstraction** (ERC-4337-like) from the first block:

- Each account is a smart contract with its own signature-validation logic.
- PQ signatures are verified via a dedicated **precompile** with stable gas cost.
- Users can define **key rotation**, **social recovery**, **paymasters**, **PQ multisig** and **delegated signing** without protocol changes.
- Addresses are derived from the **hash** of the public key (SHA3-256, last 20 bytes in hex), allowing the public key to stay hidden until the first spend from the address — elementary protection against *harvest now, decrypt later* in its basic form.

### 3.4 EVM compatibility

QRB's execution layer is a fork of the Reth (Rust) or Geth (Go) client, modified to:

- Replace the `ECRECOVER` opcode with `DSARECOVER` in native transactions.
- Add precompiles at `0x100`–`0x103` for ML-DSA-44, ML-DSA-65, ML-DSA-87 and FN-DSA-512 respectively.
- Keep all other standard EVM opcodes unchanged — any Solidity contract compiles without modification.
- Keep `ECRECOVER` functional for bridges and historical compatibility, marked as deprecated.

### 3.5 Bridge to Ethereum

The bridge is the most security-critical component of any L2. QRB adopts the **optimistic rollup** model of the current OP Stack, with:

- Proposer and verifier signatures in ML-DSA-65 from day 1.
- A 7-day challenge period, aligned with Optimism.
- A migration plan to a **ZK-rollup with STARKs** once efficient provers for Dilithium signatures exist (active research in 2026).

### 4.6 QKD integration for institutional clients (Phase 3+ vision)

Mathematical post-quantum cryptography (PQ) and physical quantum cryptography (QKD, *Quantum Key Distribution*) are **complementary, not competitors**. PQ runs over any TCP/IP network. QKD requires dedicated fiber or satellites (like Micius in China; Telefónica/Deutsche Telekom networks in the EU; Amazon Braket and the AWS Center for Quantum Networking in the US).

QRB optionally integrates QKD channels for **transaction submission** from institutional clients:

- **Use case**: a European bank with an internal QKD network (several already have them deployed after NIS2) can send its transactions to QRB over a QKD-secured channel, guaranteeing perfect confidentiality of the very act of sending the transaction, not just of its content.
- **How it works**: the institutional wallet signs with ML-DSA-65 like any user, but the submission channel to the nearest node is encrypted with a key established via BB84. The receiving node forwards to its normal mempool.
- **QRB's unique differentiator**: no other blockchain project has published a formal integration with the existing QKD stack. The wave of QKD deployments happening across Europe (NIS2 has accelerated this) opens a significant B2B market.
- **Status**: Phase 3+ vision. Requires a partnership with one or more European QKD operators. A possible path: pilots with financial clients via Cellnex, Telefónica Tech or Deutsche Telekom T-Systems.

This point makes QRB not *another* post-quantum project but **the first blockchain to recognize that the quantum era has two answers, not one**.

## 5. Tokenomics

### 5.1 The QRB token

The ecosystem's native token will be called **QRB**. Its functions are:

- **Gas payment**: all transactions are paid in QRB.
- **Staking** for decentralized sequencers and verifiers (Phase 2+).
- **Governance** of the protocol (Phase 2+).
- **Access to ecosystem services** (token deployment, naming service, paymasters, institutional QKD integration).

### 5.2 Total supply and distribution

Fixed (non-inflationary) supply: **1,000,000,000 QRB**.

| Category | % | Amount | Vesting / Unlock |
|-----------|---|----------|----------------------|
| Founder and initial team | 15% | 150,000,000 | 12-month cliff + 36-month linear vesting |
| Foundation treasury | 20% | 200,000,000 | Released by governance, max pace 2%/month |
| Validators / Stakers (rewards) | 30% | 300,000,000 | Gradual emission over 10 years |
| Ecosystem and dev grants | 25% | 250,000,000 | Released by governance |
| Initial liquidity and public offering | 10% | 100,000,000 | Activated at mainnet, subject to MiCA registration |

Deliberately conservative design: a 15% founder allocation with long vesting is below the industry standard, to avoid signaling centralization.

### 5.3 Protocol fees

Gas following the EIP-1559 model:

- **Base fee**: burned (deflationary).
- **Priority fee**: to the sequencer / proposer.
- **Protocol fee**: 15% on top of the priority fee, directed to the treasury to sustain development, audits and grants long-term.

### 5.4 Ecosystem value capture

Any token deployed on QRB (ERC-20-PQ, ERC-721-PQ, etc.) pays:

- A fixed deployment fee in QRB (~5–50 QRB depending on type).
- Transfers and operations consume gas in QRB.
- (Phase 3+) Using confidential transactions consumes a gas multiple to reflect the cost of generating the STARK proof.

---

## 6. Governance

QRB will follow a **progressively decentralized** governance model:

- **Phase 0–1**: governance centralized in the QRB Foundation (a legal entity to be constituted, probably in Spain or Switzerland). Technical decisions made by the core team, published openly.
- **Phase 2**: introduction of on-chain proposals (QRB Improvement Proposals, QIPs) binding for protocol parameters (gas, fees, treasury).
- **Phase 3+**: fully on-chain governance with a residual Foundation veto for security emergencies. An explicit plan to remove that veto after 5 years of stable mainnet.

---

## 7. Security

### 7.1 Threat model

QRB is designed against an attacker with:

- Growing quantum computational resources (potential CRQC 2028–2032 per updated expert consensus).
- *Harvest now, decrypt later* capability against the chain's public history.
- Control of up to 33% of the stake (standard BFT assumption).
- Full access to the source code (the entire project is open source MIT/Apache-2.0).

### 7.2 Audits and verification

Before mainnet (Phase 2):

- **Cryptographic audit** of the PQ signature module by a specialized firm (Trail of Bits, Least Authority, NCC Group). Estimated cost: €60,000–120,000.
- **EVM audit** of the modified execution client. €50,000–100,000.
- **Bridge audit**. €80,000–150,000.
- **Formal verification** of the PQ precompiles with Coq or Lean (24-month target).
- **Bug bounty** with a ceiling of 500,000 QRB for critical bugs.

### 7.3 Emergency plan

Emergency multisig (5 of 9, Foundation + reputable external ecosystem figures) with the power to **pause the bridge** for a maximum of 72 hours. No power over the chain's state or over user funds.

### 7.4 Risk of the PQ primitive itself

Post-quantum signatures are young cryptography. It is possible that a classical attack against Dilithium is discovered in the coming years. QRB mitigates this risk:

- **Algorithm-agnostic design**: the validation precompile is swappable.
- **A pre-established Plan B**: migration to SLH-DSA (hash-based, more conservative cryptographic assumptions) in under 30 days if Dilithium were compromised.
- **Optional hybrid signatures** during the first 24 months as an additional safety belt.

### 7.5 Confidentiality layer (Phase 3+ vision)

This section describes QRB's response to **Threat B** (retroactive harvesting). It is the piece that distinguishes QRB from every other post-quantum blockchain on the market and makes it a real privacy proposition, not just secure authentication.

#### 7.5.1 Stealth addresses

Each time a user receives a transaction, the sender's wallet derives a **single-use address** from the recipient's view and spend key pair (a model analogous to Ethereum's EIP-5564 and to Monero's, adapted to PQ primitives). The result: no observer can link two different payments to the same user. The public address QRB publishes for receiving never appears directly on-chain.

#### 7.5.2 Confidential transactions

The amount of each transaction is **encrypted** via a lattice-based cryptographic commitment (a post-quantum variant of Pedersen). Only the sender and recipient know the amount. The chain verifies that the sum of inputs equals the sum of outputs without revealing the specific amounts, by means of a range proof built on STARKs.

#### 7.5.3 ZK proofs on STARKs (a critical technical decision)

**SNARKs (Groth16, PLONK, BN254) are NOT post-quantum** — their parameters rest on elliptic-curve assumptions. Any privacy built today with SNARKs is **broken at long horizons**: harvest now, decrypt later. This is the quiet trap of projects like Aleo and Aztec, whose privacy protects today but does not hold 30 years out.

**STARKs are natively post-quantum**: they depend only on collision-resistant hash functions (modelable as a random oracle) and on Reed-Solomon codes. Larger proof size (~50–200 KB today, improving rapidly), but solid security under the most conservative known assumptions.

QRB builds its entire privacy layer on STARKs. Reference implementations: StarkWare (Cairo, already in production on Starknet), RISC Zero, Plonky3 (Polygon).

#### 7.5.4 Selective disclosure / view keys

The user can generate a **read-only** key over their history and hand it to their bank, tax advisor or regulatory authority when required. This provides the balance between **privacy by default** and **MiCA / AML compliance** without making the system transparent to everyone.

For regulated companies (banks tokenizing assets, institutional custodians), QRB also supports an **opt-in transparency** mode per contract — the contract declares its balance and movements openly, keeping the rest of the ecosystem confidential.

#### 7.5.5 Forward secrecy and periodic key rotation

The privacy layer is designed with structural **forward secrecy**: view keys can be rotated periodically without losing access to prior history, limiting the damage a key leak at a specific moment can cause.

#### 7.5.6 Impact on the gas model

STARK proofs are compute-intensive. The user will pay a gas multiple (~10–50×) for confidential transactions relative to transparent ones. This incentivizes conscious use: small day-to-day payments can go in transparent mode; large, sensitive or institutional transactions in confidential mode. The user chooses.

## 11. Risks and mitigations

| Risk | Impact | Likelihood | Mitigation |

## 12. Conclusion

QRB does not aspire to replace Ethereum or Bitcoin. It aspires to be **the default network when an organization, a protocol or a user needs real post-quantum guarantees**: when a regulated financial entity needs to custody assets with NIS2 and MiCA compliance; when an identity protocol requires signatures valid 30 years out; when a user wants to protect not only their funds but their financial history from the risk of retroactive harvesting.

The project combines:

- A **real and verifiable problem**: the quantum threat documented by NIST, Google, Caltech, Project Eleven and acknowledged by the industry itself (Jefferies, Google, Vitalik).
- A **solid, dual technical solution**: PQ for authentication, STARKs + lattice for privacy, both standardized or on conservative cryptographic assumptions.
- A **realistic market strategy**: an L2 on Ethereum, not an L1 from scratch.
- A **unique differentiation**: the only blockchain with PQ authentication + PQ privacy + EVM + Account Abstraction + planned QKD integration.
- A **legal, staged funding model**: non-dilutive grants → seed → regulated token, not the other way around.
- An **open, modest team** that prioritizes execution over hype.

The window to build this closes with every month that passes. The algorithms are standardized, quantum hardware is advancing faster than expected, and European regulation is beginning to require what QRB will offer. The invitation is open to developers, cryptographers, grant reviewers and investors: this is the moment.
