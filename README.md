# QRB — Quantum-Resistance Blockchain

> _"All of the internet from the past 40 years will become an open book, and there is nothing you can do to save the past."_

**QRB is a research and prototype track for a post-quantum Layer 2 blockchain on Ethereum-compatible infrastructure.** Phase 0 today: a working Python prototype with real ML-DSA-65 (NIST FIPS 204) signatures, a 24-page whitepaper laying out the technical, economic and regulatory model, and the open-source artifacts to apply for non-dilutive grants. Phase 1+ ahead: EVM execution layer, account abstraction with PQ keys, rollup bridge to Ethereum, public testnet — and an evolving research line toward post-quantum confidentiality on STARKs (Phase 3+ vision).

This README is deliberately careful to distinguish **implemented**, **designed**, **research** and **vision**. We owe public credibility more than hype.

## Status — what exists today vs what is on the roadmap

| Component | Status | Reference |
|-----------|--------|-----------|
| ML-DSA-65 (FIPS 204) signatures | ✅ Implemented | `prototype/qrb/crypto.py` |
| Account-based blockchain with signed blocks, transactions and state | ✅ Implemented | `prototype/qrb/` |
| CLI for wallets, transactions, block production and inspection | ✅ Implemented | `prototype/qrb_cli.py` |
| End-to-end tests (signatures, tampering, double-spend, proposer impersonation) | ✅ Implemented + CI | `prototype/tests/test_basic.py` |
| EVM-compatible execution layer with DSARECOVER precompile | 📐 Designed | Whitepaper §3.4 |
| ERC-4337-like Account Abstraction with PQ signatures | 📐 Designed | Whitepaper §3.3 |
| Optimistic rollup bridge to Ethereum L1 | 📐 Designed | Whitepaper §3.5 |
| STARK-based confidentiality (stealth addresses, confidential tx, view keys) | 🔬 Research / Phase 3+ vision | Whitepaper §7.5 |
| QKD institutional integration | 🔬 Research / Phase 3+ vision | Whitepaper §4.6 |
| Production L2 / mainnet | 🚧 Phase 2+ deliverable | Whitepaper §8 |

**The Phase 0 prototype is a single-node, local-only blockchain that demonstrates the post-quantum signature path end to end.** It does not yet implement L2 mechanics (rollup, bridge, data availability), EVM, networking, or decentralised consensus. Those are explicit Phase 1 and Phase 2 deliverables.

## Why now

In **April 2026**, an independent researcher used a publicly accessible cloud quantum computer to break a 15-bit elliptic-curve cryptography key, winning Project Eleven's _Q-Day Prize_ ([CoinDesk coverage](https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2026/04/24/researcher-wins-1-bitcoin-bounty-for-largest-quantum-attack-on-underlying-tech)). Fifteen bits is far short of the 256 used by Bitcoin and Ethereum, but the demonstration represents a 512× capability jump in seven months — and shifts the conversation from theoretical to demonstrable.

Google now estimates that breaking ECDSA-256 requires **fewer than 500,000 physical qubits** (April 2026 technical report), down from 20 million in 2019. Caltech researchers and the startup Atomic published a separate study suggesting it could potentially be done with just 10,000 qubits using atomic-architecture hardware. Current commercial quantum computers already have 1,000–2,000 qubits.

Vitalik Buterin (Ethereum founder): _"Crypto has until 2028 to avoid quantum collapse."_

Google has moved its **internal post-quantum migration deadline to 2029**, six years ahead of the NIST 2035 baseline.

In January 2026, Jefferies removed 10% of its Bitcoin allocation from model portfolios citing quantum risk explicitly.

Estimates remain estimates — the year of arrival of a cryptographically relevant quantum computer is genuinely uncertain. But the **direction is unambiguous**: in two years, the consensus window has contracted from "2040 or later" to **"2028–2032"**.

Regulatory pressure tracks the same trajectory: the EU's NIS2 (in force since October 2024) requires post-quantum resistance as a duty-of-care criterion for critical infrastructure, and MiCA (in force since December 2024) sets the regulatory framework under which any future QRB token will be issued.

## What QRB aims to combine

The columns below describe the **combination of capabilities QRB targets across its full roadmap**. As shown in the Status section above, only the first column is implemented in the Phase 0 prototype today; the others are designed in the whitepaper, planned for Phase 1, or part of the Phase 3+ research vision. The point of the table is not to claim feature parity now — it is to highlight that **no known project is pursuing all five together**.

| Project | PQ auth | PQ privacy | EVM | Account Abstraction | QKD-ready |
|---|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|
| Bitcoin / Ethereum L1 | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ Ethereum | partial | ❌ |
| QRL / Zond | ✅ | ❌ | partial | ❌ | ❌ |
| Quranium | ✅ | ❌ | partial | ❌ | ❌ |
| Aleo | ❌ (SNARK) | ✅ but NOT PQ-safe | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| Aztec | ❌ (SNARK) | ✅ but NOT PQ-safe | partial | ✅ | ❌ |
| Monero | ❌ | ✅ but NOT PQ-safe | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| **QRB (target across full roadmap)** | **✅ ML-DSA-65 (Phase 0)** | 🔬 STARKs (Phase 3+) | 📐 Phase 1 | 📐 Phase 1 | 🔬 Phase 3+ |

The privacy chains in the market today (Aleo, Aztec, Monero) build their privacy on SNARKs or non-PQ commitments — meaning their privacy is **broken at long horizons** under harvest-now-decrypt-later: data shielded today can be unshielded in the future once a cryptographically relevant quantum computer exists. QRB's research direction proposes to address this by basing its confidentiality layer on STARKs, which depend only on hash collision resistance and are therefore natively post-quantum.

## Quick start — run the prototype

The prototype is a minimal Python blockchain that demonstrates ML-DSA-65 signatures, account-based state, signed blocks, mempool and persistence. It runs locally on your laptop, single node, no networking.

**Requirements**: Python 3.10+

```bash
cd prototype
python -m venv .venv

# Windows PowerShell:
.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1

# macOS / Linux:
source .venv/bin/activate

pip install -r requirements.txt
python tests/test_basic.py
```

You should see all tests pass. **The same tests run on every push to `main` via GitHub Actions** (Python 3.10, 3.11 and 3.12) — see the CI badge above for current status.

Then play with the CLI:

```bash
python qrb_cli.py wallet create --name founder
python qrb_cli.py wallet create --name alice
python qrb_cli.py chain init --founder founder --supply 1000000000
python qrb_cli.py wallet list
# copy alice's address from the listing
python qrb_cli.py tx send --from founder --to <alice-address> --amount 1000
python qrb_cli.py chain mine --proposer founder
python qrb_cli.py wallet balance --name alice
python qrb_cli.py chain block --index 1
```

Blocks and state are persisted as JSON in `.qrb-data/` — open the files to inspect real ML-DSA-65 signatures (~3.3 KB each) and how they compose into a chain.

See [`prototype/README.md`](prototype/README.md) for full prototype documentation.

## Funding philosophy

**Product first, money second.** QRB explicitly rejects the ICO-pre-product model.

1. Non-dilutive grants first: NLNet, Ethereum Foundation, Optimism RetroPGF, Web3 Foundation, Horizon Europe.
2. Then demonstrable product + community.
3. **Only then** — token issuance registered under MiCA with proper legal counsel and a notified whitepaper.

🚫 No ICO before product. 🚫 No vaporware. 🚫 No promises without code.

## Looking for collaborators

QRB is actively recruiting for Phase 0 and early Phase 1:

- **1 Rust / Go developer** with blockchain client experience (Geth, Reth, Erigon).
- **1 cryptographer or PhD student** with lattice / Dilithium / STARK expertise.
- **1 frontend developer** for wallet and block explorer.
- **1 technical writer / communicator** (Spanish/English).

Significant contributors receive an allocation from the **Ecosystem & Grants** category (25% of total supply, terms negotiated with the QRB Foundation upon constitution).

Interested? Open an issue, send a pull request, or DM [@QRB_PQ on X](https://x.com/QRB_PQ).

## AI assistance disclosure

QRB is developed with substantial AI assistance, primarily Anthropic's Claude. This includes code generation, technical documentation drafting, market research synthesis, and editorial review.

The role separation is intentional and explicit:

- **AI is the executor.** It accelerates writing, structures content, and removes friction.
- **The human founder is the director.** All strategic, architectural, economic and editorial decisions are made by the founder. AI does not choose what QRB is — it helps express what it is.

We believe transparent disclosure of AI assistance is more honest than hiding it. The software ecosystem of 2026 embraces AI tooling as a normal part of development workflows; what is not normal — and not acceptable — is pretending otherwise. Pretending to be a 10× engineer when standing on the shoulders of AI tooling is a worse signal than openly using and crediting it.

The founder is responsible for understanding, validating, and maintaining everything in this repository. If something is unclear, open an issue — the answer will come from a human who can defend it.
